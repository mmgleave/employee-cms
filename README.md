**The Employee Database** is an interactive command-line application where a user can view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so they can organize and plan their business.

## Installation
Clone the github repository from https://github.com/mmgleave/employee-cms.git. 

## Usage
Within vs code open your terminal and type the command 'node index.js' to initialize the application. The application will then prompt the user for their choice of action. Choices available include: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role. If adding employees, departments, or roles, the user will be prompted to enter information such as salary, titles, names, etc. NOTE: Upon initialization the application will include default data from the db/seeds.sql file.
